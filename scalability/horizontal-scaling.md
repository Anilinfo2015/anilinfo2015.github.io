# Horizontal Scaling

## Overview
Horizontal scaling (scale-out) involves adding more machines or nodes to your system to handle increased load.

## Key Concepts
- Add more servers/instances
- Distribute load across multiple machines
- Linear scalability potential

## Advantages
- Cost-effective (commodity hardware)
- High availability
- Fault tolerance
- Easier to scale incrementally

## Challenges
- Application complexity
- Data consistency
- Network overhead
- Load balancing requirements

## Implementation Strategies
1. Stateless application design
2. Distributed caching
3. Database sharding
4. Session management
5. Load balancing

## Best Practices
- Design for failure
- Use auto-scaling
- Implement health checks
- Monitor resource utilization

## When to Use
- Web applications
- Microservices
- High traffic systems
- Cloud-native applications
