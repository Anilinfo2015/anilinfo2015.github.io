# Event-Driven Architecture

## Overview
Event-driven architecture is a software design pattern where system components communicate through events.

## Core Components
1. **Event Producers**: Generate events
2. **Event Consumers**: Process events
3. **Event Channel**: Transport mechanism
4. **Event Store**: Persist events

## Patterns
- **Pub/Sub**: Publishers and subscribers
- **Event Sourcing**: Store state as sequence of events
- **CQRS**: Separate read and write models

## Benefits
- Loose coupling
- Scalability
- Asynchronous processing
- Real-time capabilities

## Use Cases
- Real-time analytics
- IoT systems
- Microservices communication
- User activity tracking

## Technologies
- Apache Kafka
- RabbitMQ
- AWS EventBridge
- Azure Event Grid
